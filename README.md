Think of this website as an online cookbook where you can post your favorite recipes and discover new recipes by following friends! Recipes can be searched through tags and users have the ability to follow other users, as well as comment on recipes. 

###Built with:

* Ruby 2.3.1

* Rails

* Act as Taggable gem

* Bycrypt gem

* Bootstrap

* HTML/CSS

* Hosted on Heroku

###Steps taken for creating this project:

1. Create model for Users and Recipes
2. Get both models to interact with each other
3. Create authentication
4. Create follower/following relationship
5. Create comment model
6. Search by tags
7. Styling

###User Stories: 

* As a user I would like to have a simple sign in/ sign up form
* I would like to be able to search for recipes
* I would like to follow different users
* I would like to explore different recipes

###Unsolved Problems:
 
* Success button flashes green while submitting
* Privacy settings, i.e. can only view a profile if user has allowed you to follow them 
* Deleting an account, issue with the current user
